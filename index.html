          <p class="description">
            In our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kenza-kadiri-469001173/cuvones-podcast-project?si=e1199ca050da4fcea65f1b2408bf447a&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">podcast</a> we discussed how people are getting disconnected from their vicinity by exploiting social media, instead of connecting with the whole world using it. We shared personal experiences and TOUCH GRASS STORIES and experiences where we failed to stay connected with our friends and neighbors.
